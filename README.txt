INVISIBLE

---Game Description---
This game is about sneaking past guards in order to reach the end of each room.
Open combat with the guards is possible but intentionally very difficult.
Staying unseen is far and away the best method to reach the exits.
Can YOU become INVISIBLE?

---Game mechanics---
Each guard has their own patrol route that they will follow without pause until
they spot the player, then they become aggressive and start chasing them as well
as shooting their gun. The guards are quite hard of hearing and have very poor
eyesight: they do not react to sound, and can only see directly ahead of where
they're going. This also means that, whenever one of them is alerted, the others
will not also become alerted.

Rooms can be illuminated or dark, which can drastically affect the player and their
Night Vision Goggles: activating NVG in an illuminated room will cause the screen
to get strikingly bright and hard to read, while keeping NVG off in a dark room
makes it just as tough to see.

Each room has an exit door with which the player will need to interact in order to
go on to the next one.

The player has three different tools other than basic movement at their disposal,
all useful toward their goal of staying unnoticed:
1- The Punch: punching an unalerted guard causes them to die immediately,
   while alerted guards can take more of a beating before being defeated. This is to
   incentivize stealth gameplay.
2- The Night Vision Goggles: using these will give everything a green tint and
   drastically boost its brightness, greatly increasing visibility in dark areas.
3- The Cardboard Box: using it will allow the player to walk in the shoes of one
   of the greatest soldiers to have ever lived, Jack (or John?), as well as his
   genetic clone David. The box also causes guards to completely ignore the player,
   as such a perfect disguise makes them seamlessly blend into their surroundings,
   becoming effectively invisible. Sadly, due to the player's limited training,
   they cannot use the full potential of the box, and are limited to being completely
   still as they use it.
   "I dunno. I was just looking at it, and I suddenly got this irresistible urge to
   get inside. No... not just an urge - more than that. It was my destiny to be here;
   in the box. [...] And then, when I put it on, I suddenly got this feeling of inner
   peace. I can't put it into words. I feel... safe. Like this is where I was meant to
   be. Like I'd found the key to true happiness."

---Developer Message---
Video games are art.
Therefore I consider INVISIBLE and everything attached to it (this file included) to be a piece of art.
As such, there will be no compromises made on the inclusion of the resources/loadbearing folder memes,
as well as the generally unserious tone of the writing of this file.
(The load bearing images are required for the game to launch)
This may be a bad and derivative piece of art, but it will stay my own nonetheless.
